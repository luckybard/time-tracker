## Features

- **Automatic Time Tracking**:
  - The plugin automatically detects the branch you are working on and starts tracking time.
  - When switching branches, it stops the current timer and starts a new one for the new branch.

- **Session Management**:
  - Ability to manually pause and resume time tracking.
  - Edit sessions during or after completion:
    - Change branch name.
    - Change session name.
    - Add description.
    - Correct start and end times.
    - Delete session.

- **Local Data Storage**:
  - All session information is automatically saved in an XML file.

- **JIRA Integration**:
  - Ability to send session information as a comment to a JIRA task and update log time.

## Requirements

To use the JIRA integration feature, you need to configure the following settings in the plugin:

- **Email**: The email address associated with your JIRA account.
- **Project Key**: The key of the project to which you want to send data.
- **API Token**: An API token generated in JIRA.
- **Project URL**: The URL of the project in JIRA (e.g., `https://your-domain.atlassian.net`).

## Important Notes

1. **Branch Name Must Contain the JIRA Task Number**:
  - The plugin automatically attempts to extract the task number (e.g., `TASK-123`) from the branch name. 
  - Ensure that the branch name contains the correct task number for the JIRA data sending feature to work properly.

2. **Local Data Storage**:
  - All session data is stored locally in an XML file. This allows editing data even after completing work.
